PHPToolkit
===========

Full PSR compliant, generic classes, traits, functions, etc...

This is my personal take on some common tasks that are needed to projects, something like "my personal set of classes".

You'll find one class per file in the "class" folder, and one example usage per class in the root folder.


ToDo
----

- Include an autoloader, and therefore check if the namespaces need to change (changing them is probably needed). This will also result in justifying the "use" keyword =)
