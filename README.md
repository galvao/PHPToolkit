PHPToolkit
===========

Full PSR compliant, generic classes, traits, functions, etc...

This is my personal take on some common tasks that are needed to projects, something like "my personal set of classes".

You'll find one class per file in the "class" folder, and one example usage per class in the root folder.

## END OF LIFE
This is one of my earlier exercises on Github. It has many wrongs in it (including the fact that it would be silly to make such an "Omnipackage"). This repo will remain as a monument to silly beginnings =)


ToDo
----

- Include an autoloader, and therefore check if the namespaces need to change (changing them is probably needed). This will also result in justifying the "use" keyword =)
